# Image Editing and Animation Project

This project is a collection of interactive experiments designed to introduce the concepts of image editing and 2D animation.

## Tools Used

*   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Used to create the interactive web-based experiments.
*   **gif.js:** A JavaScript library used to create animated GIFs in the browser.

## Learnings by Topic

### Topic 1: Introduction to Image Editing & Animation
*   Learned the fundamental difference between raster (pixel-based) and vector (math-based) graphics.
*   Explored common image file formats like JPEG, PNG, and GIF and their use cases.
*   Implemented a basic image editor to adjust brightness and contrast, and to perform cropping and resizing using the HTML5 canvas.

### Topic 2: Working with Layers & Selections
*   Understood the concept of layers for non-destructive editing.
*   Simulated blending modes using CSS `mix-blend-mode` to creatively combine images.
*   Created a simple poster by layering images and text.

### Topic 3: Retouching & Manipulation
*   Learned about retouching tools like the Healing Brush and Clone Stamp.
*   Created a simplified "healing brush" simulation using the HTML5 canvas to remove blemishes from a photo by averaging pixel colors.

### Topic 4: Principles of Animation
*   Explored core animation principles like timing, squash and stretch, and ease in/ease out.
*   Implemented a bouncing ball animation that demonstrates the "squash and stretch" principle to give it a sense of weight and life.
*   Designed a simple character using HTML and CSS.

### Topic 5: 2D Animation
*   Differentiated between frame-by-frame animation and motion tweening.
*   Created a frame-by-frame animation of a character waving using JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas.
*   Used the `gif.js` library to export the animation as a GIF file directly from the browser.
