        <h3>Core Animation Principles</h3>
        <p><strong>Timing:</strong> The speed of an action, which gives meaning to movement, both in terms of physics and emotion.</p>
        <p><strong>Squash and Stretch:</strong> Gives a sense of weight and flexibility to drawn objects. The most important principle to create a feeling of life.</p>
        <p><strong>Anticipation:</strong> The preparation for an action. It makes the action more realistic and easier to follow.</p>
        <p><strong>Ease In and Ease Out:</strong> Also known as "slow in and slow out," this principle makes movement look more natural by having it start slowly, accelerate, and then slow down before stopping.</p>

        <h2>Experiment Task</h2>
        <p>A bouncing ball animation demonstrating the "squash and stretch" principle.</p>
