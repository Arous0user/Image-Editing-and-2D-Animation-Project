        <h3>Frame-by-Frame vs. Motion Tweening</h3>
        <p><strong>Frame-by-frame animation</strong> is a traditional animation technique where each frame is drawn individually. It allows for a high degree of control but can be very time-consuming.</p>
        <p><strong>Motion tweening</strong> is a technique where you create a starting and an ending keyframe, and the software automatically generates the frames in between. It is much faster than frame-by-frame animation but offers less control.</p>
        <h3>Digital Animation Tools</h3>
        <p>Tools like Krita, Adobe Animate, and After Effects provide powerful features for creating 2D animations, including layers, timelines, and onion skinning (which allows you to see previous and next frames as you draw).</p>

        <h2>Experiment Task</h2>
        <p>Create a short animated GIF of the character from Topic 4 waving. The animation will be created frame-by-frame using JavaScript.</p>
        <div class="experiment">
            <canvas id="canvas" width="200" height="250"></canvas>
            <div class="controls">
                <button id="export-gif">Export as GIF</button>
